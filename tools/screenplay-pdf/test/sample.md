## INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A busy morning. JAMES, 30s, wheelchair user, waits at the counter. His dog BUDDY sits patiently beside him.

## BARISTA
(cheerful)
The usual?

## JAMES
Yeah. Extra shot today.

## BARISTA
Rough morning?

## JAMES
You could say that.

The BARISTA makes his drink. James checks his phone. A notification: "MEDICAID CLAIM DENIED."

## JAMES (CONT'D)
(under his breath)
Of course.

He puts the phone away. Buddy looks up at him.

## JAMES (CONT'D)
(to Buddy)
Don't worry. We'll figure it out.

Buddy's tail wags. He doesn't understand the words, but he understands the tone.

The BARISTA hands over the coffee.

## BARISTA
Four fifty.

James pays. Hesitates.

## JAMES
Hey, quick question. Your dog ever get sick?

## BARISTA
My dog? Yeah, last year. Ear infection.

## JAMES
How'd that go? The vet, I mean.

## BARISTA
Oh, it was easy. Same-day appointment. They fixed her up, gave us some drops. Maybe fifty bucks after insurance.

## JAMES
(bitter laugh)
Fifty bucks.

## BARISTA
Why?

## JAMES
No reason. Just... thinking about healthcare.

He takes his coffee and wheels toward the door.

## BARISTA
(calling after him)
Hope your morning gets better!

## JAMES
(not turning back)
Thanks.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

James wheels out into the sunlight. The city bustles around him. He takes a sip of coffee.

## JAMES (V.O.)
Fifty bucks. Same-day appointment. For a dog.

He looks down at Buddy.

## JAMES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Meanwhile, I've been on hold with Medicaid for six weeks.

He starts rolling down the sidewalk. Buddy trots alongside.

## JAMES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But sure. The system works.

FADE OUT.
